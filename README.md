# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Hospital readmission within 30 days is a critical challenge for healthcare providers, impacting **patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and costs**.  

This project builds a **machine learning pipeline** to predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days based on their medical and demographic data.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- ✅ Predict 30-day hospital readmissions with high accuracy  
- ✅ Identify key factors influencing readmissions (age, length of stay, prior visits, comorbidities, etc.)  
- ✅ Support healthcare organizations in **proactive care planning and resource allocation**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, Feature engineering, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Hospital Readmission Dataset (UCI Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)  
- **Records**: ~100,000 patient records from U.S. hospitals (1999–2008)  
- **Features**:  
  - Patient demographics  
  - Admission type & discharge type  
  - Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)  
  - Medications & outcomes  

---

## 📊 Key Results  
- 📈 Achieved **~85% accuracy** in predicting 30-day readmissions  
- 🔑 Identified **top features** influencing readmission risk (e.g., inpatient visits, diabetes diagnosis, discharge type)  
- 🎯 Reduced **false negatives**, enabling hospitals to **target interventions more effectively**

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled features  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – created distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, outlier detection  
3. **Model Building** – trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models  
4. **Evaluation** – compared models using ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  
5. **Deployment (Optional)** – Streamlit app for real-time predictions (future scope)

## 📈 Business Impact  
- 🏥 Helps hospitals **reduce readmission rates**, saving significant costs  
- ❤️ Improves quality of care by identifying **at-risk patients earlier**  
- 📊 Provides a **scalable framework** for predictive healthcare analytics
